          <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>

          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions replace all prior or contemporaneous
            understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the Site.
          </p>

          <h2>General</h2>

          <p>
            The Operator shall not be liable by reason of the failure in the
            performance of obligations under the Terms and Conditions by reason
            of strikes, riots, fire, explosion, acts of God, governmental
            action, or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable control of
            the Operator, including any form of technological failure or the
            actions of third parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
            invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the
            maximum extent possible and will be deemed deleted to the extent
            that it is not enforceable, and the remaining provisions of the
            Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            The failure by the Operator to insist upon or enforce strict
            performance of any of these Terms and Conditions will not be
            construed as a waiver of any right or remedy of the Operator in
            respect of any existing or subsequent breach of these Terms and
            Conditions.
          </p>

            intellectual property rights please notify the Operator by
            electronic mail to admin@cyclingcompare.com.au. Notification, and
            any action that the Operator may take in response to the
            notification is not an admission that there has been a breach of
            intellectual property rights, or that the Operator accepts any
            liability in relation to such a breach. The Operator does not
            guarantee to take any action if notified under this clause.
